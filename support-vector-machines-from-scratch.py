"""Support Vector Machines"""
# Aims to find the best hyperplane that separates the classes in a high dimensional space 
# Uses kernel method to handle non-linear data by mapping features into higher dimensions 
# Support Vectors - Data points outside the Ïµ-margin contribute to the error and are termed "support vectors.
# Uses epsilon Tube when using SVM for Regression
